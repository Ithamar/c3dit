## Main
----
Using an external modelling utility such as Blender, AutoDesk 3D Studio Max, AutoDesk GMax and so on, you now have the capability to create your own Carnivores compatible model formats for creatures, weapons, scenery and more!

C3Dit is a utility specifically designed to work with the AtmosFear 2 engine file formats.
Specifically it is made to produce functional .CAR files for use with Carnivores, Carnivores 2 and Carnivores: Ice Age, it can also export .3DF files.


## Instructions
----
Unzip the application into some preferred location such as "Documents\Carnivores Modding\C3Dit\"
Open the directory in which you unzipped C3Dit, click on the `C3Dit.exe` executable to run the application.
Viola installation complete.

If for some reason an application setting is causing C3Dit to crash, you can delete the `C3Dit.ini` file, a default one will be automatically generated the next time C3Dit is started.

Errors are logged to `error.log` and should be attached to any bug reports.
