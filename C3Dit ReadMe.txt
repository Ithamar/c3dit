PLEASE ENABLE WORD WRAP FOR OPTIMAL VIEWING!


=====================Disclaimer========================
C3Dit is an experimental modding tool in it's beta form, I take no responsibility for any damage it may or may not cause to your hardware or software, make backups of your files before you use the tool and also for optimal protection, create a new resore point before using it as well.


=====================Changelog========================
1.5.1
* Added Specular (Gloss/Phong) Mapping
* Added Environment (Sphere) Mapping
* Added First Person View for weapons preview
* C3Dit actually loads the Specular and Environment maps from the Carnivores 2 directory, Make sure to update the Settings.ini to point to your installation, or copy/paste the files into the C3Dit directory.
* Plus minor bug fixes!


=====================Installation========================
Unzip the application into some preferred location such as "My Documents/Carnivores Modding/C3Dit/"
Open the directory in which you unzipped C3Dit, click on the C3Dit executable to run the application.
Viola installation complete.

Carnivores does not use the registry, it creates a binary settings file within the application directory labelled "settings.ini".


=====================Main============================
Using an external modelling utility such as Blender, GMax, 3dsMax and so on, you now have the capability to create your own Carnivores compatable model formats for creatures, weapons, scenery and more!
C3Dit is a utility specifically designed to work with the AtmosFear 2.0 engine file formats, taking aspects from the game code in order to provide you as the end user, the most accurate and useful utility yet.  C3Dit was created and is continuously designed to replace machf's .CAR Editor.
